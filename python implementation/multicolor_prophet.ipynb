    "We next consider the following multi-color prophet prob- lem. In this model n candidates arrive in uniform random order. Candidates are partitioned into k groups $C = {C_1,···,C_k}$. We write $n=(n1,...,nk)$ for the vector of groupsizes, i.e., $|C_j| = n_j$ ,for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k. We identify each of the groups with a distinct color and let c(i), vi denote the color and value of candidate i, respectively. The value vi that is revealed upon arrival of i, and is drawn independently from a given distribution Fi. We use $F = (F_1, . . . , Fn)$ to refer to the vector of distributions. We are also given a probability vector $p = (p_1, . . . , p_k)$. The goal is to select a candidate in an online manner in order to maximize the expectation of the value of the selected candidate, while selecting from each color with probability proportional to p. We distinguish between the basic setting in which $p_j$ is the proportion of candidates that belong to group j, i.e., $p_j = n_j/n$, and the general setting in which $p$ is arbitrary. We compare ourselves with the fair optimum, the optimal offline algorithm that respects the $p_j$ ’s."
